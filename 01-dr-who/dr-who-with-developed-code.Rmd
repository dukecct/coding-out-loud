## Task 1: Recreate

Recreate the following plot (Source: <https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/doctor-who-suffers-lowest-ratings-since-2005-revival-39028919.html>).

## Task 2: Improve

Improve the plot above.

## Task 3: Doctors and seasons

In the revived era there have been five doctors, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)#Regular_seasons) for which doctors were in which seasons. Recreate the previous visualization, this time including doctor information.

```{r doctors}

  ~season_number, ~doctor_no, ~doctor_name,
               1,          9, "Christopher Eccleston",
